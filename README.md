# Hello everyone! üëãüèº

I'm Dawid, Junior Fullstack Developer 

I have always been interested in programming and cybersecurity. However, it was not until 2022 that I took significant steps towards IT. I started my journey with the GoIT full-stack developer programming course. Currently, I am a graduate of the above-mentioned school and I am looking for my first job in IT. I invite you to view the profile.
